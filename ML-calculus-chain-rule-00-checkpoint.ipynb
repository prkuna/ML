    "### Chain rule\n",
    "#### The chain rule is a formula for calculating the derivatives of composite functions. Composite functions are functions composed of functions inside other function(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works\n",
    "Given a composite function f(x)=A(B(x)), the derivative of f(x) equals the product of the derivative of A with respect to B(x) and the derivative of B with respect to x.\n",
    "\n",
    "composite function derivative=outer function derivative ∗ inner function derivative\n",

    "For example, given a composite function f(x), where:\n",
